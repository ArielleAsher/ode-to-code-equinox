his code assumes that there are three CSV files - inventory.csv that contains the current inventory levels, purchase.csv that contains information about all the purchases made, and sales.csv that contains information about all the sales made. The functions calculate_inventory_value, calculate_purchase_value, and calculate_sales_value read the respective CSV files and calculate the total value of the inventory, purchases, and sales respectively. The generate_report function calls these functions and generates a report that shows the total inventory value, total purchase value, total sales value, and the profit made by subtracting the purchase value from the sales value.
You can modify this code to generate more complex reports, such as reports on the best-selling products, low inventory levels, etc. by using additional functions that read and analyze the CSV files.
